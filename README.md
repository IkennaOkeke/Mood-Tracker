# 📱 MoodTracker - CMPUT 301 W25  
### *Your Emotional Wingman, Built for the Grind*  

Picture this: an Android app so slick, so clutch, it’s like a therapist, journal, and hype squad rolled into one. *MoodTracker* isn’t just about “tracking feelings”—it’s about owning your mental game, crushing self-doubt, and flexing emotional awareness like a pro. Designed for university students and staff (but honestly, anyone with a pulse), this bad boy’s here to revolutionize well-being—one mood at a time.

**Spoiler:** No one’s touching us. We’re APR-free, social media-free, *ad-free*, and privacy-obsessed. No pop-ups, no nonsense—just pure vibes. Try to compete. We dare you.
