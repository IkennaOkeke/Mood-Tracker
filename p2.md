# Project Part 2 Feedback 

## Product Backlog

Acceptance Criteria for (US 01.02.01) 
"Given multiple mood events 
use the same emotional state
When retrieving that emotional state
Then its usage count should reflect the total number
 of times it was used"  => It is unclear what you mean

US 01.05.01 (Mood Event Edit Screen)
Emotional State (only needs one emotional state for a 
mood event according to the client (Henry)),
 there are only two checkpoints that are considered 
(so change that to either Halfway-checkpoint of final checkpoint)

US 01.06.01 (Mood Event Delete Feature)
- you mentioned the experience in the front end when a mood 
event is deleted but ommited mentioning what happens in the backend. 
You might as well not bother about mentioning frontend but since you
did, you have to mention backend. You also didn't assign 
milestone to this user story.

US 03.01.01 - Unique User Username
I was wondering if you can accomodate users that do not wish to 
provide usernames explicitly. Can you your system auto-generate one for them?

No milestone was specified for this even thoough this wasn't in the project
 description, since you added it, please specify the milestone

set 40\% as halfway checkpoint => so you need at least 10 user stories milestones set as halfway checkpoint
General comments => make the requirements sub-issues.

## CRC Cards

MoodEvent (there shouldn't be e.t.c) you can replace
it with an other associated mood event data

- MoodHistory: not sure what "manage event subscriptions
mean".

FiresbaseDB : manage subscriptions, not sure what that means

## UI Mockups

Storyboard sequences arrows are not labelled 
- label the arrows indicating what data is shared 
between transitions
- the arrows are overlaying on other screens
 because related screens are not close to each other. 
- Bring related screens together so that you don't have to run long
overlayed arrows on the screens
